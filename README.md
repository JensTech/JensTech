# Hi, I'm JensTech
### I make the odd project here and there, but I mostly work in private repos.
I am currently focussing on a project called SideWeb, More spoilers further into development.

## This repository may contain random projects that don't fit into their own.
If so, I will list them below:

- HTMLMarkdown: HTMLMarkdown is a github themed markdown displayer for HTML. It does not translate it to html, just displays it.
  Find HTMLMarkdown here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/JensTech/JensTech/tree/main/HTMLMarkdown)
